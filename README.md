# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All I did was put this information online for the world to see and the matter will finally be put to rest.

I wrote code that creates a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). I also allow our users to filter the table data for specific values using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

Planet Earth needs to know what I have found!

## Tasks

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* I used the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

### Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](StarterCode/static/js/data.js)
